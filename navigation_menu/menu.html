    <center><h1>Casiopea</h1></center>
    <p>Casiopea 1st
        The first label to sign them was Alfa Records, which released their album Casiopea. "Galactic Funk" appeared on their 1981 album Cross Point (1981) with ten different versions recorded both live and in studio. The album Eyes of the Mind was released in the United States in 1981. They then released Mint Jams (1982), followed during the same year by 4x4, which was recorded with Lee Ritenour, Harvey Mason, Nathan East, and Don Grusin. The band's first overseas concert was in the United Kingdom in 1983. The band has toured Europe, South America, Australia, and Southeast Asia. In 1987, Casiopea signed to Polydor. Akira Jimbo and Tetsuo Sakurai, who played drums and bass, respectively, as part of the first "Classic Lineup" of Casiopea, left the band after years of musical differences. They formed the duo Jimsaku.
        
        Casiopea 2nd
        With only Issei Noro and Minoru Mukaiya remaining from the original Casiopea lineup, Yoshihiro Naruse (bass) and Masaaki Hiyama (drums) joined the band. Casiopea then signed to Pioneer. In 1993, Noriaki Kumagai replaced Masaaki, and a year later the band returned to the Alfa label, then to Pony Canyon. In 1997 Jimbo returned as a part-time member, recording more albums and writing compositions.
        
        In 2000, the band again signed to Pioneer. Four years later Pioneer changed its name to Geneon Entertainment. On August 1, 2006, Issei Noro, the group's leader, decided to freeze all activities of the band until further notice.[1] In 2007, Noro and Jimbo, formed the fusion band Inspirit.
        
        In January 2009, Casiopea participated in the album Tetsudou Seminar Ongakuhen, based on Minoru Mukaiya's Train Simulator video games.
        
        On May 27, 2009, a limited-edition box set, Legend of Casiopea, was released to commemorate the band's thirtieth anniversary.
        
        Casiopea 3rd
        On April 20, 2012, it was announced that Casiopea would return with Kiyomi Otaka on keyboards, replacing Minoru Mukaiya, who led his own music production team Mukaiya Club.
        
        During the 2010 decade Casiopea 3rd resumed album releases, and both Casiopea 3rd and Inspirits held a joint concert as a result of having a common bandleader in Issei Noro.
        
        During the Covid-19 crisis, Issei Noro released a song thanking all those on the frontlines.
        
        Signature songs
        Asayake
        In Japanese, "Asayake" means "Morning Glow". The song was first recorded for their second album, Super Flight (1979), then re-released on their fourth album, Eyes of the Mind in 1981, and live for Mint Jams in 1982. The "Mint Jams" version is a regular favorite, and is often played as an encore number or last number. With the bridge of the song having long notes, the lead guitarist (Issei Noro) has a free hand, to pump his fist for the next 1 and a half-measure of the song. The intro of this song consists often of a Rhythm-Guitar Riff. The 1995 J-Pop/Rap song, "Asayake" by Yuki Mori and MC Gaku samples the Intro Guitar riff from Casiopea's "Asayake" extensively.
        
        Domino Line
        The first recording of "Domino Line" was in Cross Point from 1981. Then it was performed for Mint Jams in a different arrangement. The Mint Jams version includes a part where each instrument plays a note or chord, then is followed by another in the next 16th Note, usually in this order: Drums, guitar, bass, keyboard. On Mint Jams, this builds up to a technical and relatively long bass solo, followed by a drum solo. On the Asian Dreamer version from 1994, this break is modified to be played in different chords, times, tempos, etc. On Tetsuo Sakurai's arrangement from "My Dear Musiclife", the song is further modified, adding a Saxophone solo.
        
        Galactic Funk
        Like "Domino Line," the first recording of "Galactic Funk" was also in Cross Point, featuring solos from guitarist Issei Noro and keyboardist Minoru Mukaiya, then bassist Tetsuo Sakurai and drummer Akira Jimbo trading solos. The song was recorded again with guitarist Lee Ritenour, pianist Dave Grusin, drummer Harvey Mason and bassist Nathan East for the 1982 album 4x4 (Four by Four), with both guitarists trading solos, both keyboardists trading solos, and a trade between the bassists and drummers collectively.
        
        Space Road
        This song was first recorded on Casiopea's debut Self-Titled Album, Casiopea (1979). This song is known for its Main Theme, which is repeated 4 times but modulated to an upper Minor-3rd each time. This song is usually played at the Early-to-Middle of their Live Concerts. The Live versions often include a break in which the Guitarist, Keyboardist, and Bassist play the same solo over the Chords from the Intro.
        
        Black Joke
        Like "Space Road", this song was included in Casiopea. Intro and ending of this song includes a lot of 16th-note-triplets in impressive unison phrases, and song to symbolize their technical aspects.
        
        Eyes of the Mind
        The first version of this song was included in Make Up City as "Eyes of Mind". Then, the song was re-released on its own album, Eyes of the Mind.</p><p>Casiopea 1st
